&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first half of Summer 2023, I did a program at Northeastern’s Seattle campus, where I took a user experience design class (CS4973 is the generic special topics class code). Throughout that class, we were tasked with a design project relating to the Museum of History and Industry (MOHAI) in the South Lake Union area (by the Amazon Headquarters).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In groups, our job was to propose a redesign of a certain part of the Indigenous Peoples Exhibit. My group focused on the Native American stories they had playing throughout the exhibit on screens. Our job was to reimagine how people interacted with these stories.
We completed a full cycle of the design process using common brainstorming tools like Miro and prototyping tools like Balsmiq Wireframes and Axure RP. While Figma is the primary design tool I use, this project was a good way to learn other software and expand my skill set as a designer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Cool Corner - Tactical Media Project</title>

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cool Corner is a Tactical Media project I did as my final project for my Experience and Interaction class (ARTF2223). Geert Lovink and David Garcia define Tactical Media as &amp;ldquo;what happens when the cheap &amp;lsquo;do it yourself&amp;rsquo; media, made possible by the revolution in consumer electronics and expanded forms of distribution (from public access cable to the internet), are exploited by groups and individuals who feel aggrieved by or excluded from the wider culture…&amp;rdquo; Essentially, Tactical Media is an art movement that combines art, experimental media, and political activism.
I made my project about the closing of GeoCities from the view of an average user. The website is coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and is made to emulate how a GeoCities website could have looked at the time, as well as emulate how it would have felt to see your personal website break and disappear before you.
This project was a major step forward for me because up till this point my projects had been pretty surface level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zach also has extensive research experience, and is studying UX privacy and dark patterns through an honors project at Northeastern’s College of Arts, Media and Design. He takes pride in approaching design through an interdisciplinary perspective thanks to his computer science background and intersectional legal research. He approaches his projects with an eye for detail that can only come from a unique perspective of multiple areas of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
