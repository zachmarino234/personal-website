        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;proposal&#34;&gt;Proposal
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Title:&lt;/strong&gt; Investigating the Impacts of Design Thinking on the Journalistic Process&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Supervising Professor:&lt;/strong&gt; Sofie Hodara&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;synopsis&#34;&gt;Synopsis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project seeks to answer what it means to think like a designer through the exploration and designed intervention of the domain of journalism and the journalistic process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a friend who recently started her co-op as a living/arts reporter for the Boston Globe. When I was talking to her about work, she mentioned she was stuck thinking of pitches to show her editor. My advice to her was to think like a designer: Who am I writing for? What are the demographics and interests of my audience? What stakeholders are involved? These are natural thoughts to have when creating a product (or in this case an article) but the conscious act of considering these factors allows us to narrow down our audience. With these questions answered, she adjusted her pitches and got two accepted, gaining a byline in her first week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone can think like a designer, but what separates a designer from other jobs that also problem-solve? What does it mean to “think like a designer?” I plan to answer this question by investigating a specific domain and designing a solution. In the spirit of my friend and my 8 months as a Product co-op at the Boston Globe, I want to redesign the journalistic process for reporters. Specifically, I want to synthesize different elements of popular design kits (like the one created by IDEO) and alter them to apply specifically to arts/culture/lifestyle/sports reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deliverables&#34;&gt;Deliverables
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UX research, including personas, user stories, sketches, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low, medium, and high-fidelity prototypes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System Usability Scale Results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final presentation of research, product, and results\&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;timeline&#34;&gt;Timeline
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project will be broken up into five phases:\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 1: Audit different design kits and their characteristics - 1 week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 2: Audit the journalistic process and create a wireframe of a potential solution - 2 weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 3: Test process on existing toolkits - 1 week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 4: Create a new design kit to fit in with the journalistic process - 1 month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 5: Test the new kit with journalists (System Usability Scale) - 2 weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 6: Analysis of Results - 1 week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My supervising professor and I will meet once a week for 30 minutes to check in and discuss progress on each phase. The primary constraint with these phases are tracking down reporters, interviewing them, and having them test out a solution. I have a couple of leads I can follow to get people involved, including my former co-workers at the Globe and the BU/The New School journalism schools. I plan to meet with these contacts individually and talk to at least 3 of them for each phase requiring user input. I plan to do a weekly exercise to reflect on the thought processes practiced in other professions besides reporting, reflecting on my findings.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://zmarino.com/posts/talenttrace/TalentTrace.png" alt="Featured image of post TalentTrace" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;TalentTrace is a job tracker and aggregate job data app that my group and I created for our final project in CS3200 Database Design. Users can add jobs entries to TalentTrace and see all of their applications at a glance. They can also see aggregate data from all job entries to see and analyze market trends. Recruiters can use TalentTrace to keep track of applicants and any interviews they have with them. The project repository can be found on my github or by clicking the button below.&lt;/p&gt;

    Repository
&lt;/a&gt;
  
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tech-stack&#34;&gt;Tech Stack
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our tech stack consists of MySQL for the database, Flask for the backend, and Streamlit for the frontend. This stack was provided to us in a template created by our professor that we forked. Each tier was containerized using docker. While DevOps was not the focus of this project, since finishing this project I have investigated and learned how to setup a similar tech stack and containerize every tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;database&#34;&gt;Database
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our database is coded in MySQL and contains a DDL file as well as several files housing mock data generated by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.mockaroo.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Mockaroo&lt;/a&gt;. Before coding the database files, we first did a very basic design iteration and identified our users and their needs. We then took those needs and translated them into a large Entity-Relationship diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zmarino.com/posts/talenttrace/ER-diagram.webp&#34;
	width=&#34;9120&#34;
	height=&#34;3168&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;287&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;690px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the diagram ready to go, we translated it into a DDL file which was set to run every time the MySQL docker container was spun up using &lt;code&gt;docker compose up db&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;backend-api&#34;&gt;Backend API
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We built our API using Flask. Our professor provided the template for the project so all setup was done for us, we just needed to create routes and blueprints to connect the database to the frontend. We created a blueprint for each entity that required a route like job entries, users, etc. We also had a route for all of our aggregate queries. An alternative method to connect the database to the frontend would have been to create a couple of large routes and running any specific queries in the frontend using pandas but that would have been bad practice. It is better to keep the database and frontend as separate as possible, and it was easier to just create extra routes or abstract already made routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;frontend&#34;&gt;Frontend
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our frontend was built with Streamlit, a data visualization tool written in python. Streamlit was not built to run an application like our project, but the focus of the class was not on front-end development and Streamlit was easy to pick up as everything is prebuilt. We mocked user authentication using buttons and session states and created flows for each persona. Each persona needed to have a GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE route. Our project was not graded on UX or visual design, but considering my skillset, I wanted to add some design elements to make sure our app felt good to use despite the limited framework. We added confirmation messages to any forms, downloaded more advanced data viz frameworks to better display the data, and I created a logo to add an extra touch of cohesiveness to our project.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;TalentTrace logo designed by me&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend too much time with the logo as it did not impact our grade but I still wanted to make something interesting (or at least better than the AI generated logos other teams were using). The &amp;ldquo;trace&amp;rdquo; in TalentTrace reminded me of a light/spotlight which is represented by the yellow streak that runs through the two T&amp;rsquo;s. The blue was chosen because it complemented well with the yellow when I was picking colors. The geometric look was used because we felt it looked professional without being generic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to this class, my last computer science class was Algorithms which really killed a lot of my interest in computer science. This project brought my enthusiasm back. It was incredibly fun learning how to bring all of these different parts of software engineering together into a cohesive product. I feel like I finally see the full picture in regards to what I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning and it also made me realize I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; design or computer science, I want to do both. I still find backend development (specifically algorithms) intimidating but I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to enjoy databases as much as I did.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chain - A Word Connecting Card Game</title>
        <link>https://zmarino.com/posts/chain/</link>

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chain is a card game I designed in a group in Design Perspectives (ARTG1001) taught by Northeastern Professor Lee Moreau during the Fall 2023 semester. There were no rules on what our game had to be or how it was played, it just had to be accessible to most skill levels. My job in the group was to develop the rules for the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took on the ruleset because prior to this project, a majority of my design work had been for a digital medium so I wanted to explore a physical medium and challenge myself with a new type of design. My groupmates worked on the visual design of the cards and the instructions, and we all contributed to the list of words we would put on the cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alloc8 is a personal finance app that I created in ARTG 2400 Interaction Design Principles, taught by Professor Sofie Hodara, for my final project. We started in small groups and did user research together, interviewing our friends and family about their personal finance habits. From these user interviews we developed an idea of what users wanted from a personal finance app, and created our own seperate prodicts to solve this design issue. I ended up on a personal finance app that automatically allocates your paycheck into rent, budgets, spending goals, etc. as decided by the user, and the extra money left over can be used to either temporarily increase budgets or add to other goals.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Ethics of Dark Patterns</title>

        <guid>https://zmarino.com/posts/ethics-of-dark-patterns/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Ethics of Dark Patterns is a paper and final project I wrote for my Tech Regulations of Digital Platforms class (CS4973) taught by Northeastern Law professor Elettra Bieti. The paper discusses the conception and proliferation of dark patterns, and how they can potentially be regulated from both a legal and ethical standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark patterns are defined as instances where designers use their knowledge of human behavior (e.g., psychology) and the desires of end users to implement deceptive functionality that is not in the user’s best interest &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3174108&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first half of Summer 2023, I did a program at Northeastern’s Seattle campus, where I took a user experience design class (CS4973 is the generic special topics class code). Throughout that class, we were tasked with a design project relating to the Museum of History and Industry (MOHAI) in the South Lake Union area (by the Amazon Headquarters).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In groups, our job was to propose a redesign of a certain part of the Indigenous Peoples Exhibit. My group focused on the Native American stories they had playing throughout the exhibit on screens. Our job was to reimagine how people interacted with these stories.
We completed a full cycle of the design process using common brainstorming tools like Miro and prototyping tools like Balsmiq Wireframes and Axure RP. While Figma is the primary design tool I use, this project was a good way to learn other software and expand my skill set as a designer. It was also the first time I worked on a design project with a real client as compared to a made-up scenario for a class project.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Where did all of the Serif Typefaces Go?</title>
        <link>https://zmarino.com/posts/where-did-all-the-serif-typefaces-go/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 17:16:35 -0400</pubDate>

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stripes is the name of the first project I completed in Design Perspectives (ARTG1001) taught by Northeastern Professor Lee Moreau during the Fall 2023 semester. The goal of this project was to document when/where you see some chosen design element or motif, and create an infographic showcasing them. I decided on serif typefaces as my &amp;ldquo;stripes&amp;rdquo; and walked through Boston looking for any serif typefaces. Unfortunately, I found little to none. I decided instead of throwing in the towel and picking a different topic, I decided to approach this from the other end: &amp;ldquo;Where did all of the serif typefaces go?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;infographic-design&#34;&gt;Infographic Design
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serif typefaces give off a sense of credibility, opulence, and history. Considering these themes, I wanted my infographic to feel similarly luxiorious. However, considering I am framing this infographic as an investigation, I wanted to give this infographic the feeling of an investigative journalist reporting their findings. What I ended up with is a nice mixture of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pink accent color was chosen because it was a less saturated pink that made it feel similar to rose gold. The offset boxes highlighting important words was added to emulate the (stereotypically) sloppy highlighting of a reporter. I learned in my typography class this semester that it often works to pair a serif typeface with a sans-serif one so I decided to try that on this infographic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least from my experience, a lot of &amp;ldquo;luxury&amp;rdquo; brands and products incorporate very provocative typography into their branding so I tried to mirror this with the large pink type in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typefaces I used, Essonnes and Poppins, were chosen because they fit together aesthetically and my only criteria was pairing a serif and sans-serif typeface together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Two Designer Timeline was my final project for ARTH2215 Graphic Design History, where I had to create a timeline documenting the life of two seperate designers in an accordion-style booklet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;designers&#34;&gt;Designers
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two designers I decided to research were Raymond Loewy and Carin Goldberg. Raymond Loewy is known for being the progenitor of Streamlining, and creating the streamlined and futuristic look we associate with the 1940s-60s. Carin Goldberg was an accomplished graphic designer who designed the cover for Madonna&amp;rsquo;s iconic self-titled album and the covers for many books and magazines. She sadly passed away shortly before I started working on this project from a brain tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;timeline-design&#34;&gt;Timeline Design
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design of the timeline, while simple, conveys a lot of meaning. Following Loewys streamlining and Goldbergs simplified shapes and creative use of typography, I kept the timeline simple yet dynamic so that it is easy to read yet interesting stylistically. Besides the background, only three colors are used and they represent which events correspond to which designer or a general world event. This design language is kept consistent throughout to further ensure legibility for readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest struggles on this project (besides the initial artists block) was how I laid out each page. I was cramming too much into each page so the layouts felt cramped and rigid. This is still something I am actively working on as a designer, but on this project I realized this issue on my first iteration of what would be the final draft and gave my elements some breathing room in later iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cool Corner is a Tactical Media project I did as my final project for my Experience and Interaction class (ARTF2223). Geert Lovink and David Garcia define Tactical Media as &amp;ldquo;what happens when the cheap &amp;lsquo;do it yourself&amp;rsquo; media, made possible by the revolution in consumer electronics and expanded forms of distribution (from public access cable to the internet), are exploited by groups and individuals who feel aggrieved by or excluded from the wider culture…&amp;rdquo; Essentially, Tactical Media is an art movement that combines art, experimental media, and political activism.
I made my project about the closing of GeoCities from the view of an average user. The website is coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and is made to emulate how a GeoCities website could have looked at the time, as well as emulate how it would have felt to see your personal website break and disappear before you.
This project was a major step forward for me because up till this point my projects had been pretty surface level. &lt;/p&gt;
