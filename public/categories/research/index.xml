        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;proposal&#34;&gt;Proposal
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Title:&lt;/strong&gt; Investigating the Impacts of Design Thinking on the Journalistic Process&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Supervising Professor:&lt;/strong&gt; Sofie Hodara&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;synopsis&#34;&gt;Synopsis
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project seeks to answer what it means to think like a designer through the exploration and designed intervention of the domain of journalism and the journalistic process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a friend who recently started her co-op as a living/arts reporter for the Boston Globe. When I was talking to her about work, she mentioned she was stuck thinking of pitches to show her editor. My advice to her was to think like a designer: Who am I writing for? What are the demographics and interests of my audience? What stakeholders are involved? These are natural thoughts to have when creating a product (or in this case an article) but the conscious act of considering these factors allows us to narrow down our audience. With these questions answered, she adjusted her pitches and got two accepted, gaining a byline in her first week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone can think like a designer, but what separates a designer from other jobs that also problem-solve? What does it mean to “think like a designer?” I plan to answer this question by investigating a specific domain and designing a solution. In the spirit of my friend and my 8 months as a Product co-op at the Boston Globe, I want to redesign the journalistic process for reporters. Specifically, I want to synthesize different elements of popular design kits (like the one created by IDEO) and alter them to apply specifically to arts/culture/lifestyle/sports reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deliverables&#34;&gt;Deliverables
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UX research, including personas, user stories, sketches, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low, medium, and high-fidelity prototypes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System Usability Scale Results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final presentation of research, product, and results\&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;timeline&#34;&gt;Timeline
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project will be broken up into five phases:\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 1: Audit different design kits and their characteristics - 1 week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 2: Audit the journalistic process and create a wireframe of a potential solution - 2 weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 3: Test process on existing toolkits - 1 week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 4: Create a new design kit to fit in with the journalistic process - 1 month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 5: Test the new kit with journalists (System Usability Scale) - 2 weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase 6: Analysis of Results - 1 week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My supervising professor and I will meet once a week for 30 minutes to check in and discuss progress on each phase. The primary constraint with these phases are tracking down reporters, interviewing them, and having them test out a solution. I have a couple of leads I can follow to get people involved, including my former co-workers at the Globe and the BU/The New School journalism schools. I plan to meet with these contacts individually and talk to at least 3 of them for each phase requiring user input. I plan to do a weekly exercise to reflect on the thought processes practiced in other professions besides reporting, reflecting on my findings.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Ethics of Dark Patterns</title>
        <link>https://zmarino.com/posts/ethics-of-dark-patterns/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Ethics of Dark Patterns is a paper and final project I wrote for my Tech Regulations of Digital Platforms class (CS4973) taught by Northeastern Law professor Elettra Bieti. The paper discusses the conception and proliferation of dark patterns, and how they can potentially be regulated from both a legal and ethical standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark patterns are defined as instances where designers use their knowledge of human behavior (e.g., psychology) and the desires of end users to implement deceptive functionality that is not in the user’s best interest &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3174108&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;(Gray et al., 2018, p.1)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Where did all of the Serif Typefaces Go?</title>
        <link>https://zmarino.com/posts/where-did-all-the-serif-typefaces-go/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2023 17:16:35 -0400</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://zmarino.com/posts/where-did-all-the-serif-typefaces-go/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://zmarino.com/posts/where-did-all-the-serif-typefaces-go/Stripes.png" alt="Featured image of post Where did all of the Serif Typefaces Go?" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stripes is the name of the first project I completed in Design Perspectives (ARTG1001) taught by Northeastern Professor Lee Moreau during the Fall 2023 semester. The goal of this project was to document when/where you see some chosen design element or motif, and create an infographic showcasing them. I decided on serif typefaces as my &amp;ldquo;stripes&amp;rdquo; and walked through Boston looking for any serif typefaces. Unfortunately, I found little to none. I decided instead of throwing in the towel and picking a different topic, I decided to approach this from the other end: &amp;ldquo;Where did all of the serif typefaces go?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;infographic-design&#34;&gt;Infographic Design
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serif typefaces give off a sense of credibility, opulence, and history. Considering these themes, I wanted my infographic to feel similarly luxiorious. However, considering I am framing this infographic as an investigation, I wanted to give this infographic the feeling of an investigative journalist reporting their findings. What I ended up with is a nice mixture of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pink accent color was chosen because it was a less saturated pink that made it feel similar to rose gold. The offset boxes highlighting important words was added to emulate the (stereotypically) sloppy highlighting of a reporter. I learned in my typography class this semester that it often works to pair a serif typeface with a sans-serif one so I decided to try that on this infographic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least from my experience, a lot of &amp;ldquo;luxury&amp;rdquo; brands and products incorporate very provocative typography into their branding so I tried to mirror this with the large pink type in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typefaces I used, Essonnes and Poppins, were chosen because they fit together aesthetically and my only criteria was pairing a serif and sans-serif typeface together.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Two Designer Timeline</title>

&lt;/a&gt;
  
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Two Designer Timeline was my final project for ARTH2215 Graphic Design History, where I had to create a timeline documenting the life of two seperate designers in an accordion-style booklet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;designers&#34;&gt;Designers
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two designers I decided to research were Raymond Loewy and Carin Goldberg. Raymond Loewy is known for being the progenitor of Streamlining, and creating the streamlined and futuristic look we associate with the 1940s-60s. Carin Goldberg was an accomplished graphic designer who designed the cover for Madonna&amp;rsquo;s iconic self-titled album and the covers for many books and magazines. She sadly passed away shortly before I started working on this project from a brain tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;timeline-design&#34;&gt;Timeline Design
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design of the timeline, while simple, conveys a lot of meaning. Following Loewys streamlining and Goldbergs simplified shapes and creative use of typography, I kept the timeline simple yet dynamic so that it is easy to read yet interesting stylistically. Besides the background, only three colors are used and they represent which events correspond to which designer or a general world event. This design language is kept consistent throughout to further ensure legibility for readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest struggles on this project (besides the initial artists block) was how I laid out each page. I was cramming too much into each page so the layouts felt cramped and rigid. This is still something I am actively working on as a designer, but on this project I realized this issue on my first iteration of what would be the final draft and gave my elements some breathing room in later iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
