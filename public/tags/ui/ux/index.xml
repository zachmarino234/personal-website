        <title>Boston Globe Innovation Week 2024</title>

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every quarter, the Boston Globe hosts an event called &lt;strong&gt;innovation week&lt;/strong&gt;, where any globe employee can pitch any idea. The best ideas are looked into and potentially implemented depending on the scope of the work and its alignment with company values. The judges consisted of company executives and the Boston Globe innovation team, as well as voting from other participants. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.bostonglobemedia.com/innovation/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;More information on the innovation week initiative can be found on the Boston Globe corporate website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was the only co-op of 32 to submit a proposal and while I didn&amp;rsquo;t win, I won the &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s try it&amp;rdquo; designation, which meant the judges liked my idea at a high-level and wanted to look into it further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-proposal&#34;&gt;My proposal
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(This description of my proposal is intentionally left vague as my entry to innovation week is intellectual property of the Boston Globe)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my first couple of months at the globe, I noticed the way we display the scores of Boston sports games was really basic and lacked any particularly good user experience. Specifically, the banner that shows up on the homepage of Boston.com did not fit with the style of the rest of the website and only showed the score. I figured that the banner could use a facelift and we could use the opportunity to make the banner much more detailed and user-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;product-research&#34;&gt;Product Research
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With my proposal in mind, I looked into our competitors for sports content and how we differed from them. I also learned that according to the &amp;hellip; however many ppl used a second screen when watching a sports game.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chain - A Word Connecting Card Game</title>

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chain is a card game I designed in a group in Design Perspectives (ARTG1001) taught by Northeastern Professor Lee Moreau during the Fall 2023 semester. There were no rules on what our game had to be or how it was played, it just had to be accessible to most skill levels. My job in the group was to develop the rules for the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took on the ruleset because prior to this project, a majority of my design work had been for a digital medium so I wanted to explore a physical medium and challenge myself with a new type of design. My groupmates worked on the visual design of the cards and the instructions, and we all contributed to the list of words we would put on the cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alloc8 is a personal finance app that I created in ARTG 2400 Interaction Design Principles, taught by Professor Sofie Hodara, for my final project. We started in small groups and did user research together, interviewing our friends and family about their personal finance habits. From these user interviews we developed an idea of what users wanted from a personal finance app, and created our own seperate prodicts to solve this design issue. I ended up on a personal finance app that automatically allocates your paycheck into rent, budgets, spending goals, etc. as decided by the user, and the extra money left over can be used to either temporarily increase budgets or add to other goals.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Ethics of Dark Patterns</title>
        <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/ethics-of-dark-patterns/</link>

        <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/ethics-of-dark-patterns/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Ethics of Dark Patterns is a paper and final project I wrote for my Tech Regulations of Digital Platforms class (CS4973) taught by Northeastern Law professor Elettra Bieti. The paper discusses the conception and proliferation of dark patterns, and how they can potentially be regulated from both a legal and ethical standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark patterns are defined as instances where designers use their knowledge of human behavior (e.g., psychology) and the desires of end users to implement deceptive functionality that is not in the user’s best interest &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3174108&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

        <title>MOHAI Native Stories</title>

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first half of Summer 2023, I did a program at Northeastern’s Seattle campus, where I took a user experience design class (CS4973 is the generic special topics class code). Throughout that class, we were tasked with a design project relating to the Museum of History and Industry (MOHAI) in the South Lake Union area (by the Amazon Headquarters).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In groups, our job was to propose a redesign of a certain part of the Indigenous Peoples Exhibit. My group focused on the Native American stories they had playing throughout the exhibit on screens. Our job was to reimagine how people interacted with these stories.
We completed a full cycle of the design process using common brainstorming tools like Miro and prototyping tools like Balsmiq Wireframes and Axure RP. While Figma is the primary design tool I use, this project was a good way to learn other software and expand my skill set as a designer. It was also the first time I worked on a design project with a real client as compared to a made-up scenario for a class project.&lt;/p&gt;
