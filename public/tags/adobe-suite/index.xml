&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alloc8 is a personal finance app that I created in ARTG 2400 Interaction Design Principles, taught by Professor Sofie Hodara, for my final project. We started in small groups and did user research together, interviewing our friends and family about their personal finance habits. From these user interviews we developed an idea of what users wanted from a personal finance app, and created our own seperate prodicts to solve this design issue. I ended up on a personal finance app that automatically allocates your paycheck into rent, budgets, spending goals, etc. as decided by the user, and the extra money left over can be used to either temporarily increase budgets or add to other goals.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Where did all of the Serif Typefaces Go?</title>

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stripes is the name of the first project I completed in Design Perspectives (ARTG1001) taught by Northeastern Professor Lee Moreau during the Fall 2023 semester. The goal of this project was to document when/where you see some chosen design element or motif, and create an infographic showcasing them. I decided on serif typefaces as my &amp;ldquo;stripes&amp;rdquo; and walked through Boston looking for any serif typefaces. Unfortunately, I found little to none. I decided instead of throwing in the towel and picking a different topic, I decided to approach this from the other end: &amp;ldquo;Where did all of the serif typefaces go?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;infographic-design&#34;&gt;Infographic Design
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serif typefaces give off a sense of credibility, opulence, and history. Considering these themes, I wanted my infographic to feel similarly luxiorious. However, considering I am framing this infographic as an investigation, I wanted to give this infographic the feeling of an investigative journalist reporting their findings. What I ended up with is a nice mixture of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pink accent color was chosen because it was a less saturated pink that made it feel similar to rose gold. The offset boxes highlighting important words was added to emulate the (stereotypically) sloppy highlighting of a reporter. I learned in my typography class this semester that it often works to pair a serif typeface with a sans-serif one so I decided to try that on this infographic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least from my experience, a lot of &amp;ldquo;luxury&amp;rdquo; brands and products incorporate very provocative typography into their branding so I tried to mirror this with the large pink type in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typefaces I used, Essonnes and Poppins, were chosen because they fit together aesthetically and my only criteria was pairing a serif and sans-serif typeface together.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Two Designer Timeline</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Two Designer Timeline was my final project for ARTH2215 Graphic Design History, where I had to create a timeline documenting the life of two seperate designers in an accordion-style booklet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;designers&#34;&gt;Designers
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two designers I decided to research were Raymond Loewy and Carin Goldberg. Raymond Loewy is known for being the progenitor of Streamlining, and creating the streamlined and futuristic look we associate with the 1940s-60s. Carin Goldberg was an accomplished graphic designer who designed the cover for Madonna&amp;rsquo;s iconic self-titled album and the covers for many books and magazines. She sadly passed away shortly before I started working on this project from a brain tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;timeline-design&#34;&gt;Timeline Design
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design of the timeline, while simple, conveys a lot of meaning. Following Loewys streamlining and Goldbergs simplified shapes and creative use of typography, I kept the timeline simple yet dynamic so that it is easy to read yet interesting stylistically. Besides the background, only three colors are used and they represent which events correspond to which designer or a general world event. This design language is kept consistent throughout to further ensure legibility for readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest struggles on this project (besides the initial artists block) was how I laid out each page. I was cramming too much into each page so the layouts felt cramped and rigid. This is still something I am actively working on as a designer, but on this project I realized this issue on my first iteration of what would be the final draft and gave my elements some breathing room in later iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
