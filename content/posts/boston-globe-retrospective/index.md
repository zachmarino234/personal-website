## Introduction

Late 2023, I accepted a co-op position as a product manager at the Boston Globe starting in January of 2024. I completed the six month co-op term then stayed on part time for another two months until August 2024. I worked primarily on the Boston.com team but also worked on other Globe projects like the corporate website. I also participated in innovation week, which is an initiative where all employees are invited to brainstorm and build a pitch to address pain points or flesh out creative ideas.

## What I learned


The primary hard skills I learned were related to product management and design. I learned how to coordinate work on a project, ticket and prioritize issues, and take in stakeholder feedback to align our goals with the wider editorial mission of the Boston Globe. I also learned how to collate and analyze key performance indicators, , and work within the Wordpress ecosystem.

In terms of soft skills, I learned how to function and get work done in a corporate environment, stay on top of meetings, converse with stakeholders and coworkers, and 

## Reflection

One of my favorite parts about working at the Globe was that since my team was so small, I was able to jump around and do different tasks that weren't necessarily part of my job description. A great example of this is a project I was working on towards the end of my co-op term. While I can't share any specifics as it hasn't been released yet, it was a project that required developers to style in a niche format with complicated documentation. I took on the challenge of doing it myself and managed to code it all for the developers. I didn't have to do this as I wasn't hired as a web developer, but I wanted to because I felt that to get the most out of my co-op I should challenge myself. 

This challenge I gave myself (along with the Database Design class I was taking concurrently while being part-time) helped me realize that what I wanted to do post-college wasn't strictly computer science or design, but rather the combination of both in the form of UX engineering. I sincerely thank all my coworkers and my boss, Richard Rinker for giving me the opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute to the Boston Globe.
