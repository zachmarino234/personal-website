Zach Marino is a third-year Computer Science and Design combined student at Northeastern University. He previously worked on the Product Management team at The Boston Globe, where he contributed to the mission of Boston.com and its editorial staff.  

Zach also has extensive research experience and is studying the design process through a journalistic lens by completing a directed study at Northeasternâ€™s College of Arts, Media, and Design. He takes pride in approaching design through an interdisciplinary perspective thanks to his computer science background and intersectional legal research. He approaches his projects with an eye for detail that can only come from a unique perspective of multiple areas of interest. 

In his spare time, Zach enjoys listening to music, photography, cooking, and rooting for the Philadelphia Phillies!
